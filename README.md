- [Who is this for?](#who-is-this-for)

## What is this
This is the home of all of the data-munging business logic that ultimately powers a variety of the data in the Artemis application suite, including the [Terminal](https://app.artemis.xyz/), [Sheets](https://www.artemis.xyz/sheets), and [Snowflake](https://www.artemis.xyz/datashare) integration. 

## Who is this for
If you're in this repository, you're likely one of the following:
- a **researcher** who is trying to better understand methodology
- a **protocol** that would like to self-list on Artemis
- a **data analyst** that would like to add new protocol or metric (and possibly be compensated for their contributions via a bounty)
